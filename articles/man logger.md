       logger - enter messages into the system log

## [](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html#SYNOPSIS)SYNOPSIS        

       **logger** [options] [_message_]

## [](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html#DESCRIPTION)DESCRIPTION        

       **logger** makes entries in the system log.

       When the optional _message_ argument is present, it is written to the
       log.  If it is not present, and the **-f** option is not given either,
       then standard input is logged.

## [](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html#OPTIONS)OPTIONS        

       **-d**, **--udp**
              Use datagrams (UDP) only.  By default the connection is tried
              to the syslog port defined in /etc/services, which is often
              514 .

              See also **--server** and **--socket** to specify where to connect.

       **-e**, **--skip-empty**
              Ignore empty lines when processing files.  An empty line is
              defined to be a line without any characters.  Thus a line
              consisting only of whitespace is NOT considered empty.  Note
              that when the **--prio-prefix** option is specified, the priority
              is not part of the line.  Thus an empty line in this mode is a
              line that does not have any characters after the priority
              prefix (e.g. **<13>**).

       **-f**, **--file** _file_
              Log the contents of the specified _file_.  This option cannot be
              combined with a command-line message.

       **-i** Log the PID of the logger process with each line.

       **--id**[**=**_id_]
              Log the PID of the logger process with each line.  When the
              optional argument _id_ is specified, then it is used instead of
              the logger command's PID.  The use of **--id=$$** (PPID) is
              recommended in scripts that send several messages.

              Note that the system logging infrastructure (for example
              **systemd** when listening on /dev/log) may follow local socket
              credentials to overwrite the PID specified in the message.
              [logger(1)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html) is able to set those socket credentials to the given
              _id_, but only if you have root permissions and a process with
              the specified PID exists, otherwise the socket credentials are
              not modified and the problem is silently ignored.

       **--journald**[**=**_file_]
              Write a systemd journal entry.  The entry is read from the
              given _file_, when specified, otherwise from standard input.
              Each line must begin with a field that is accepted by
              journald; see [systemd.journal-fields(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.journal-fields.7.html) for details.  The use
              of a MESSAGE_ID field is generally a good idea, as it makes
              finding entries easy.  Examples:

                  **logger --journald <<end**
                  **MESSAGE_ID=67feb6ffbaf24c5cbec13c008dd72309**
                  **MESSAGE=The dogs bark, but the caravan goes on.**
                  **DOGS=bark**
                  **CARAVAN=goes on**
                  **end**

                  **logger --journald=entry.txt**

              Notice that **--journald** will ignore values of other options,
              such as priority.  If priority is needed it must be within
              input, and use PRIORITY field.  The simple execution of
              **journalctl** will display MESSAGE field.  Use **journalctl**
              **--output json-pretty** to see rest of the fields.

              To include newlines in MESSAGE, specify MESSAGE several times.
              This is handled as a special case, other fields will be stored
              as an array in the journal if they appear multiple times.

       **--msgid** _msgid_
              Sets the RFC5424 MSGID field.  Note that the space character
              is not permitted inside of _msgid_.  This option is only used if
              **--rfc5424** is specified as well; otherwise, it is silently
              ignored.

       **-n**, **--server** _server_
              Write to the specified remote syslog _server_ instead of to the
              system log socket.  Unless **--udp** or **--tcp** is specified, **logger**
              will first try to use UDP, but if this fails a TCP connection
              is attempted.

       **--no-act**
              Causes everything to be done except for writing the log
              message to the system log, and removing the connection or the
              journal.  This option can be used together with **--stderr** for
              testing purposes.

       **--octet-count**
              Use the RFC 6587 octet counting framing method for sending
              messages.  When this option is not used, the default is no
              framing on UDP, and RFC6587 non-transparent framing (also
              known as octet stuffing) on TCP.

       **-P**, **--port** _port_
              Use the specified _port_.  When this option is not specified,
              the port defaults to syslog for udp and to syslog-conn for tcp
              connections.

       **-p**, **--priority** _priority_
              Enter the message into the log with the specified _priority_.
              The priority may be specified numerically or as a
              _facility_._level_ pair.  For example, **-p local3.info** logs the
              message as informational in the local3 facility.  The default
              is **user.notice**.

       **--prio-prefix**
              Look for a syslog prefix on every line read from standard
              input.  This prefix is a decimal number within angle brackets
              that encodes both the facility and the level.  The number is
              constructed by multiplying the facility by 8 and then adding
              the level.  For example, **local0.info**, meaning facility=16 and
              level=6, becomes **<134>**.

              If the prefix contains no facility, the facility defaults to
              what is specified by the **-p** option.  Similarly, if no prefix
              is provided, the line is logged using the _priority_ given with
              **-p**.

              This option doesn't affect a command-line message.

       **--rfc3164**
              Use the RFC 3164 BSD syslog protocol to submit messages to a
              remote server.

       **--rfc5424**[**=**_without_]
              Use the RFC 5424 syslog protocol to submit messages to a
              remote server.  The optional _without_ argument can be a comma-
              separated list of the following values: **notq**, **notime**, **nohost**.

              The **notq** value suppresses the time-quality structured data
              from the submitted message.  The time-quality information
              shows whether the local clock was synchronized plus the
              maximum number of microseconds the timestamp might be off.
              The time quality is also automatically suppressed when **--sd-id**
              **timeQuality** is specified.

              The **notime** value (which implies **notq**) suppresses the complete
              sender timestamp that is in ISO-8601 format, including
              microseconds and timezone.

              The **nohost** value suppresses [gethostname(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gethostname.2.html) information from
              the message header.

              The RFC 5424 protocol has been the default for **logger** since
              version 2.26.

       **-s**, **--stderr**
              Output the message to standard error as well as to the system
              log.

       **--sd-id** _name_[**@**_digits_]
              Specifies a structured data element ID for an RFC 5424 message
              header.  The option has to be used before **--sd-param** to
              introduce a new element.  The number of structured data
              elements is unlimited.  The ID (_name_ plus possibly **@**_digits_) is
              case-sensitive and uniquely identifies the type and purpose of
              the element.  The same ID must not exist more than once in a
              message.  The **@**_digits_ part is required for user-defined non-
              standardized IDs.

              **logger** currently generates the **timeQuality** standardized
              element only.  RFC 5424 also describes the elements **origin**
              (with parameters ip, enterpriseId, software and swVersion) and
              **meta** (with parameters sequenceId, sysUpTime and language).
              These element IDs may be specified without the **@**_digits_ suffix.

       **--sd-param** _name_**="**_value_**"**
              Specifies a structured data element parameter, a name and
              value pair.  The option has to be used after **--sd-id** and may
              be specified more than once for the same element.  Note that
              the quotation marks around _value_ are required and must be
              escaped on the command line.

                  **logger --rfc5424 --sd-id zoo@123               **
                                   **--sd-param tiger="hungry"   **
                                   **--sd-param zebra="running"  **
                                   **--sd-id manager@123           **
                                   **--sd-param onMeeting="yes"  **
                                   **"this is message"**

              produces:

                **<13>1 2015-10-01T14:07:59.168662+02:00 ws kzak - - [timeQuality tzKnown="1" isSynced="1" syncAccuracy="218616"][zoo@123 tiger="hungry" zebra="running"][manager@123 onMeeting="yes"] this is message**

       **-S**, **--size** _size_
              Sets the maximum permitted message size to _size_.  The default
              is 1KiB characters, which is the limit traditionally used and
              specified in RFC 3164.  With RFC 5424, this limit has become
              flexible.  A good assumption is that RFC 5424 receivers can at
              least process 4KiB messages.

              Most receivers accept messages larger than 1KiB over any type
              of syslog protocol.  As such, the **--size** option affects logger
              in all cases (not only when **--rfc5424** was used).

              Note: the message-size limit limits the overall message size,
              including the syslog header.  Header sizes vary depending on
              the selected options and the hostname length.  As a rule of
              thumb, headers are usually not longer than 50 to 80
              characters.  When selecting a maximum message size, it is
              important to ensure that the receiver supports the max size as
              well, otherwise messages may become truncated.  Again, as a
              rule of thumb two to four KiB message size should generally be
              OK, whereas anything larger should be verified to work.

       **--socket-errors**[**=**_mode_]
              Print errors about Unix socket connections.  The _mode_ can be a
              value of **off**, **on**, or **auto**.  When the mode is auto logger will
              detect if the init process is systemd, and if so assumption is
              made /dev/log can be used early at boot.  Other init systems
              lack of /dev/log will not cause errors that is identical with
              messaging using [openlog(3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/openlog.3.html) system call.  The [logger(1)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html) before
              version 2.26 used openlog, and hence was unable to detected
              loss of messages sent to Unix sockets.

              The default mode is **auto**.  When errors are not enabled lost
              messages are not communicated and will result to successful
              return value of [logger(1)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html) invocation.

       **-T**, **--tcp**
              Use stream (TCP) only.  By default the connection is tried to
              the _syslog-conn_ port defined in /etc/services, which is often
              _601_.

              See also **--server** and **--socket** to specify where to connect.

       **-t**, **--tag** _tag_
              Mark every line to be logged with the specified _tag_.  The
              default tag is the name of the user logged in on the terminal
              (or a user name based on effective user ID).

       **-u**, **--socket** _socket_
              Write to the specified _socket_ instead of to the system log
              socket.

       **--** End the argument list.  This allows the _message_ to start with
              a hyphen (-).

       **-V**, **--version**
              Display version information and exit.

       **-h**, **--help**
              Display help text and exit.
