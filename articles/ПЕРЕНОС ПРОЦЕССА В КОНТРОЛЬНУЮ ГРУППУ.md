# ПЕРЕНОС ПРОЦЕССА В КОНТРОЛЬНУЮ ГРУППУ

Move a process into a cgroup by running the  `cgclassify`  command, for example:

```
cgclassify -g cpu,memory:group1 1701
```

The syntax for  `cgclassify`  is:

```
cgclassify -g subsystems:path_to_cgroup pidlist
```

where:

*   _subsystems_ is a comma‑separated list of subsystems, or  `*`  to launch the process in the hierarchies associated with all available subsystems. Note that if cgroups of the same name exist in multiple hierarchies, the  `-g`  option moves the processes in each of those groups. Ensure that the cgroup exists within each of the hierarchies whose subsystems you specify here.
    
*   _path\_to\_cgroup_ is the path to the cgroup within its hierarchies.
    
*   _pidlist_ is a space-separated list of _process identifier_ (PIDs).
    

If the  `-g`  option is not specified,  `cgclassify` automatically searches the `/etc/cgrules.conf` file (see [Section 2.8.1, “The cgred Service”](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/sec-Moving_a_Process_to_a_Control_Group#The_cgred_Service) ) and uses the first applicable configuration line. According to this line, `cgclassify` determines the hierarchies and cgroups to move the process under. Note that for the move to be successful, the destination hierarchies must exist. The subsystems specified in `/etc/cgrules.conf` also have to be properly configured for the corresponding hierarchy in `/etc/cgconfig.conf` .

You can also add the `--sticky` option before the_pid_to keep any child processes in the same cgroup. If you do not set this option and the **cgred** service is running, child processes are allocated to cgroups based on the settings found in `/etc/cgrules.conf` . However, the parent process remains in the cgroup in which it was first started.

Using `cgclassify` , you can move several processes simultaneously. For example, this command moves the processes with PIDs `1701` and `1138` into cgroup `group1/` :

~\]#  `cgclassify -g cpu,memory:group1 1701 1138` 

Note that the PIDs to be moved are separated by spaces and that the specified groups should be in different hierarchies.

### Alternative method

To move a process into a cgroup directly, write its PID to the `tasks` file of the cgroup. For example, to move a process with the PID `1701` into a cgroup at `/cgroup/cpu_and_mem/group1/` :

```
echo 1701 > /cgroup/cpu_and_mem/group1/tasks
```

### 2.8.1. The cgred Service

 **Cgred** is a service (which starts the `cgrulesengd` service) that moves tasks into cgroups according to parameters set in the `/etc/cgrules.conf` file. Entries in the `/etc/cgrules.conf` file can take one of these two forms:

```
user subsystems control\group

user:command subsystems control\group
```

Replace_user_with a user name or a group name prefixed with the "@" character. Replace_subsystems_with a comma‑separated list of subsystem names, _control\_group_ represents a path to the cgroup, and_command_stands for a process name or a full command path of a process.

For example:

```
maria			devices		/usergroup/staff
```

This entry specifies that any processes that belong to the user named `maria` access the `devices` subsystem according to the parameters specified in the `/usergroup/staff` cgroup. To associate particular commands with particular cgroups, add the_command_parameter, as follows:

```
maria:ftp		devices		/usergroup/staff/ftp
```

The entry now specifies that when the user named `maria` uses the `ftp` command, the process is automatically moved to the `/usergroup/staff/ftp` cgroup in the hierarchy that contains the `devices` subsystem. Note, however, that the daemon moves the process to the cgroup only after the appropriate condition is fulfilled. Therefore, the `ftp` process might run for a short time in the wrong group. Furthermore, if the process quickly spawns children while in the wrong group, these children might not be moved.

Entries in the `/etc/cgrules.conf` file can include the following extra notation:

*    `@` — indicates a group instead of an individual user. For example, `@admins` are all users in the `admins` group.
    
*    `*` — represents "all". For example, `*` in the `subsystem` field represents all mounted subsystems.
    
*    `%` — represents an item that is the same as the item on the line above.
    

For example, the entries specified in the `/etc/cgrules.conf` file can have the following form:

```
@adminstaff		devices		/admingroup
@labstaff		%		%
```

The above configuration ensures that processes owned by the `adminstaff` and `labstaff` access the `devices` subsystem according to the limits set in the `admingroup` cgroup.

Rules specified in `/etc/cgrules.conf` can be linked to templates configured either in the `/etc/cgconfig.conf` file or in configuration files stored in the `/etc/cgconfig.d/` directory, allowing for flexible cgroup assignment and creation.

For example, specify the following template in `/etc/cgconfig.conf` :

```
template users/%g/%u {
	 cpuacct{
	 }
	 
	 cpu {
			cpu.shares = "1000";
	 }
}
```

Then use the_users/%g/%u_template in the third row of a `/etc/cgrules.conf` entry, which can look as follows:

```
peter:ftp		cpu		users/%g/%u
```

The `%g` and `%u` variables used above are automatically replaced with group and user name depending on the owner of the  `ftp` process. If the process belongs to `peter` from the `adminstaff` group, the above path is translated to `users/adminstaff/peter` . The `cgred` service then searches for this directory, and if it does not exist, `cgred` creates it and assigns the process to `users/adminstaff/peter/tasks` . Note that template rules apply only to definitions of templates in configuration files, so even if "_group users/adminstaff/peter_" was defined in `/etc/cgconfig.conf` , it would be ignored in favor of "_template users/%g/%u_".

There are several other variables that can be used for specifying cgroup paths in templates:

*    `%u` — is replaced with the name of the user who owns the current process. If name resolution fails, UID is used instead.
    
*    `%U` — is replaced with the UID of the specified user who owns the current process.
    
*    `%g` — is replaced with the name of the user group that owns the current process, or with the GID if name resolution fails.
    
*    `%G` — is replaced with the GID of the cgroup that owns the current process.
    
*    `%p` — is replaced with the name of the current process. PID is used in case of name resolution failure.
    
*    `%P` — is replaced with the PID of the current processes.
